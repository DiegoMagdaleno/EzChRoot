# EzChroot

## NOTICE: Due to changes in library cache in macOS Big Sur, this repository has been deprecated and no development of EzChRoot will take place, unless a workaround is found.

## EzChRoot should work without issues under Catalina and Linux, but if they ever break I can't fix, unless a workaround for Big Sur is found.

A new tool for easily creating and managing your chroots in Darwin based systems (macOS and friends)!
